Front end only site using React Components, partials, HTML and CSS. Built this for a client that I have been working with for 4 years. They were just looking for a new look from their last site. 

Lessons Learned:
Working with components definitely saved me a lot of time building this site and while I didn't need the partials, I went ahead and included them so I can easily add more pages if the client decides to expand their site to multiple pages.
