Front end only site using React Components, partials, webhooks, and HTML and CSS. Built this for a client that I have been working with for 4 years. They were just looking for a new look from their last site. 

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write something. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

Lessons Learned:
Working with components definitely saved me a lot of time building this site and while I didn't need the partials, I went ahead and included them so I can easily add more pages if the client decides to expand their site to multiple pages.

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
